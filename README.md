## Cenit Admin

This is a React application for the administration of a Cenit Platform instance, that is currently under development.
Follow these instructions to configure a local instance of Cenit and connect it as a backend for the app.

### Configuring the Backend

1. Make sure the Cenit **local repository is up to date with the remote**. The developed branch of Cenit
to support the Admin Backed is `admin_backend`.

2. The `admin_backend` development branch includes features that are not yet synced with the `develop` and `master`
branches (for example the support of built-in apps). For this reason is strongly recommended to **use a dedicated
database.** To define a custom database just include in the `config/application.yml` file an entry
`DB_DEV: custom_db_name`.    

2. **Configure the Cenit listening port.** By default the Admin App runs listening to the port `3000` therefore the local
instance of Cenit should run listening to a different one. By default the App expect Cenit to be listening to the port
`3001`, so launch Cenit listening to the port `3001`.

3. **Configure the Cenit HOMEPAGE URL.** Make sure that Cenit HOMEPAGE URL is synced with the listening port by including
in the `config/application.yml` file the entry `HOMEPAGE: http://127.0.0.1:3001`.

4. **Configure the default URI for the admin app.** By default the Admin App runs listening to the port `3000`.
Include in the `config/application.yml` file the entry `'Cenit::Admin:default_uri': http://localhost:3000`.

And that's all!
